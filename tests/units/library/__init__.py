    "boosting sales of the PlayStation, helping to cement Sony's "
    "dominant position over other fifth-generation console "
    "manufacturers. This was especially true in the case of <a "
    'href="//www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-64/3045-43/" '

    'href="/player-character/3015-968/" '
    'data-ref-id="3015-968">playable characters</a>, fighting '

    'data-ref-id="3015-1427">2D</a> predecessors in the same '

    'introduced in <a href="/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829/" '
    'data-ref-id="3030-20829">Final Fantasy IV</a>. By default, '

    'href="/party-system/3015-125/" '
    'data-ref-id="3015-125">party</a> characters, requiring '

    "The maximum party size for Final Fantasy VII is limited to "

    'gameplay features is the <a href="/materia/3055-27/" '
    'data-ref-id="3055-27">Materia</a> system. Throughout the '
    "game, the player's party can collect spheres of crystallized "

    'called "Materia" containing the essence of <a '
    'href="/magic/3015-98/" data-ref-id="3015-98">magic</a>, with '
    "a total of eighty-three different varieties of Materia in "
    "all. Most of the game's equippable weapons and armor feature "
    "slots into which Materia can be inserted, granting the wearer "
    "powerful spells or other special abilities. Just as in "
    "previous Final Fantasy titles, using spells and certain "
    'abilities in battle also requires <a href="/mp/3015-762/" '
    'data-ref-id="3015-762">MP</a>.</p><p>By wearing equipped '
    'Materia into battle, it can gain Ability Points (or "AP") and '
    '<a href="/leveling-up/3015-475/" '
    'data-ref-id="3015-475">level-up</a> just like a playable '
    "character, potentially unlocking new and stronger abilities. "
    "Once a single piece of Materia reaches its <a "
    'href="/level-cap/3015-3025/" data-ref-id="3015-3025">maximum '
    'level</a>, it is "Mastered" and produces a <a '
    'href="/clone/3015-284/" data-ref-id="3015-284">copy</a> of '
    "itself, which can be equipped and leveled-up in the same way. "
    "Certain pieces of equipment feature double or even triple "
    '"growth rates" for AP, allowing the wielder to level-up '
    "equipped Materia more quickly. Conversely, equipment with "
    "zero growth rates or even a total lack of Materia slots can "
    'also be found.</p><figure data-align="left" '

    "PlayStation Network</h2><p>On April 10th 2009, Final Fantasy "
    "7 was released onto the Japanese PSN Store for 1,500 Yen. On "
    "June 3rd 2009, Final Fantasy 7 was released for the European "
    "and American PSN stores for €9.99 and $9.99 respectively. "
    "This announcement was made days before during Sony's press "
    "conference of E3 2009. June 4th Marked the release of FF7 on "
    "the UK PSN store for the price of £7.99.</p><h2>PC Releases "
    "and Requirements</h2><p>Final Fantasy VII was published for "
    "Windows 95 by Eidos not long after the original Playstation "
    "release, in June of 1998, coming on multiple CDs like its "
    "console counterpart did. This version was largely intact in "
    "comparison to the console release, with a few "
    "differences:</p><ul><li>Polygonal graphics were smoother, "
    "employing texture filtering and taking advantage of the PC's "
    "higher resolution, with a 3D "
    "accelerator.</li><li>Pre-rendered graphics appeared grainier "
    "due to the low resolution of the renders juxtaposed with "
    "higher native resolution of computer "
    "monitors.</li><li>Soundtrack was output in MIDI format; "
    "quality of orchestration was thus dependent on the PC's sound "
    "card (a hack was later made available to import the "
    "Playstation sound file library such that the music was "
    "rendered to sound exactly how it did on "
    "consoles).</li><li>Localization was cleaned up, removing the "
    "poor grammar, missing words, and misspellings of the original "
    "console release.</li><li>Game's aesthetics were moddable, "
    "thanks to homebrew hacks, such that different character "
    "models, combat areas and sound themes could be applied "
    "providing for a more modern look and feel.</li></ul><p>Square "
    "Enix then re-released this PC version in August of 2012, "
    "exclusively from its online store as a digital download. The "
    "differences between console version and initial PC release "
    "apply with this re-release as well; in other words, "
    "backgrounds are still low-res and music is still MIDI. With "
    "this re-release, the following further changes "
    "apply:</p><ul><li>36 achievements are integrated into the "
    "game.</li><li>Character booster gives players the option to "
    "increase their character stats and money without restriction "
    "should they desire to just play through the plot (i.e. cheat "
    "through the game).</li><li>Support for cloud "
    "saves.</li><li>The game is no longer moddable natively and "
    'must undergo a total conversion process to the "old" version '
    "of the game in order to be modded (doing this removes the "
    "achievements, character booster, and cloud "
    "saves).</li></ul><p><b>Original Windows requirements "

    "Due to this a lot of buzz was being created around the "

    "of a remake.</p><p>Soon after Square Enix made an official "
